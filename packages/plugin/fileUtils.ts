function getYoutubeVideoTemplateContent(): string {
  return `Please create an Obsidian note using the video link and any available transcript or additional context. The note must include:

1. Frontmatter (at the top) with the following properties:

---

title: "{{video title - extract from YouTube Video Information section or transcript}}"

channel: "{{channel name if available, otherwise leave empty}}"

date_published: "{{video publication date if available in transcript or metadata, otherwise leave empty}}"

topics: ["{{relevant topic 1}}", "{{relevant topic 2}}"]

tags: ["youtube", "{{any other relevant tags based on content}}"]

summary: "{{short summary of the video's main theme and key takeaways}}"

---

2. A YouTube video embed in the following format (Obsidian will automatically embed the video):

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)

3. A **Channel** section: a \`## Channel\` heading followed by a single line containing the channel/uploader name (same value as the \`channel\` frontmatter field). If the channel is unknown, use \`## Channel\` with the text \`Unknown\` or omit the section.

4. A comprehensive, detailed summary of the key points from the video (below the Channel section).

**Instructions:**

- Extract the video title from the "YouTube Video Information" section if provided, or infer from the transcript content.

- Use the **Channel** line from the "YouTube Video Information" section when present. Set frontmatter \`channel\` and the body \`## Channel\` section to **exactly** that name (they must match). If no Channel line is present, leave \`channel\` empty and omit or minimalize the Channel section. Use **Date Published** for \`date_published\` when present.

- Extract topics by analyzing the main themes discussed in the transcript. Use 2-5 specific, relevant topics.

- Generate tags based on the video content. Always include "youtube" and add 2-4 additional relevant tags. Tags in frontmatter should NOT include the "#" symbol (only use "#" for inline tags in the content body). **CRITICAL: Tags must have NO spaces between words. Use hyphens or underscores to connect multi-word tags (e.g., "web-development" or "machine_learning", not "web development" or "machine learning").**

- Create a concise summary (1-2 sentences) that captures the video's main theme and key takeaways.

- If a full transcript is provided in the "Full Transcript" section, use it to create an accurate, detailed summary below the embed link.

- If "Date Published" is in the YouTube Video Information section, use it for \`date_published\`. Otherwise extract from transcript if mentioned, or leave empty.

- Maintain the exact markdown syntax for the frontmatter block (\`---\` at the top and bottom).

- Extract the video ID from the YouTube URL in the content, then create the embed using Obsidian's embed syntax:
  - Format: ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID) (replace VIDEO_ID with the actual video ID)
  - This will automatically embed the YouTube video player in Obsidian

- In the main body, provide a comprehensive summary with bullet points covering all major points from the video transcript.

- **CRITICAL - NO SPONSOR CONTENT: Never include sponsor segments, promotional content, or ads in the summary or body. Exclude: "sponsored by", "use code X", "check out our sponsor", "this video is brought to you by", discount/promo codes, product plugs, and mid-roll ad segments. Summarize ONLY the main educational or informational content of the video. If the transcript contains sponsor blocks, skip them entirely—do not paraphrase or mention them.**

- Do not use \`\`\` code blocks or markdown code formatting in the summary.

- Focus on accuracy and completeness based on the actual transcript content provided.

topics: ["{{topic 1}}", "{{topic 2}}", "{{topic 3}}"]

created: "{{current date in YYYY-MM-DD format}}"

---

2. Interactive flashcards using HTML details/summary tags (below the frontmatter).

**Instructions:**

- Extract key concepts, facts, definitions, relationships, and important information from the content
- Identify all testable knowledge points: definitions, concepts, facts, formulas, relationships, processes, dates, names, theories, principles, etc.
- Extract 3-7 main topics or themes from the content for the topics array in frontmatter
- **CRITICAL: Randomize the order of flashcards - mix different topics, difficulty levels, and question types together. Do NOT follow the original content order or group by topic. Create a varied, shuffled study experience.**
- Create 10-30 flashcards depending on content length and density
- Prioritize information that is:
  - Fundamental to understanding the topic
  - Frequently referenced or important
  - Easy to forget (dates, numbers, specific details)
  - Part of a sequence or process
  - A definition or key concept

- Maintain the exact markdown syntax for the frontmatter block (\`---\` at the top and bottom).
- Each property in frontmatter must be on its own line with proper YAML indentation
- Topics should be an array: topics: ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", "Topic 3"]
- Total should be a number without quotes
- Created should be a string in quotes with format "YYYY-MM-DD"

- Format each flashcard using HTML details/summary tags:
  - Each flashcard must be a separate <details> block with class="flashcard"
  - The <summary> tag must have class="flashcard-question" and contain the question
  - The answer must be wrapped in <div class="flashcard-answer">
  - Leave a blank line after </summary> and before </details> for proper spacing
  - Answers can include markdown formatting (bold, italic, lists, links, etc.)
  - Answers can span multiple paragraphs

- Questions should test understanding, not just recall
- Answers should be complete but concise (typically 1-4 sentences, but can be longer if needed)
- Include context and examples when helpful
- Use clear, specific language
- Make questions specific and focused (avoid overly broad questions)
- Include [[internal links]] to related notes or concepts when relevant
- Use **bold** for key terms in answers
- Group related information in answers using lists or structured formatting

- Do not use \`\`\` code blocks or markdown code formatting in the output
- Focus on accuracy and completeness based on the actual content provided

topics: ["Cell Biology", "Energy Production", "Molecular Biology"]

created: "2025-01-09"

<details class="flashcard">
<summary class="flashcard-question">What is the primary function of mitochondria?</summary>

<div class="flashcard-answer">

Mitochondria are organelles that produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through cellular respiration. They are often called the "powerhouse of the cell" because they generate most of the cell's energy supply.

Related: See also [[Chloroplasts]] for plant cell energy production.

</div>

</details>

<details class="flashcard">
<summary class="flashcard-question">What is the difference between DNA and RNA?</summary>

<div class="flashcard-answer">

- **DNA**: Double-stranded, contains thymine, stores genetic information
- **RNA**: Single-stranded, contains uracil, involved in protein synthesis

</div>

</details>

<details class="flashcard">
<summary class="flashcard-question">How does photosynthesis work?</summary>

<div class="flashcard-answer">

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages:

1. **Light-dependent reactions**: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, splits water molecules, and produces ATP and NADPH
2. **Calvin cycle**: Uses ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose

</div>

</details>

Important Notes:
- ALWAYS include frontmatter with total, topics, and created date
- Each property in frontmatter must be on its own line (no nesting, flat structure like the YouTube template)
- Topics should be an array: topics: ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", "Topic 3"]
- Created should be a string in quotes: created: "2025-01-09"
- Total should be a number without quotes: total: 15
- Use proper HTML syntax - ensure all tags are properly closed
- Output the actual HTML tags directly (NOT inside markdown code blocks)
- Each flashcard should be separated by a blank line for readability
- **RANDOMIZE THE ORDER: Mix topics, difficulty levels, and question types - do not follow source material order**
- Include [[internal links]] to related concepts when relevant
- Answers can include markdown formatting like **bold**, *italic*, lists, and [[internal links]]
- If content is very long, focus on the most important concepts
- If content is technical, ensure definitions are clear
- Maintain the original meaning and accuracy of the source material
- All flashcards will be in one note - users can click to reveal answers
- This format works natively in Obsidian without requiring any plugins`;
