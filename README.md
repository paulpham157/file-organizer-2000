# Note Companion (formerly File Organizer 2000)

Turn messy captures into clean, searchable notes — **transcribe audio/YouTube, chat with your vault, and auto-organize files** right inside Obsidian.
Works with **Note Companion Cloud** or a **self-hosted backend** where you configure your own AI provider keys.

> ✅ Best for: researchers, students, meeting-heavy workflows, and anyone with an "Inbox" full of unprocessed notes.

## What you can do

- 🎬 **Transcribe YouTube videos** (multi-language, works even when captions aren't available in the usual way)
- 🎙️ **Transcribe audio & video files** (handles large files reliably)
- 🧠 **Chat with your notes** using vault context (mention files/folders/tags)
- 🗂️ **Auto-organize & format notes** (folder/tag/title/template suggestions; optional "Inbox" automation)
- 🧾 **Meeting recorder → Enhance note** (transcript, discussion points, action items, embedded audio)
- 🔌 **Multiple AI providers**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, Ollama/local models, and custom base URLs
- 🏠 **Self-hosting supported** (Docker + service examples)

## Install

**Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → Browse → "Note Companion" → Install → Enable**

### Platform support (Obsidian)

**This plugin is for Obsidian on desktop only** (Windows, macOS, and Linux). It is marked **desktop-only** in the plugin manifest, so **Obsidian on iPhone, iPad, and Android will not load it** and may show it as unsupported on mobile.

The plugin is built and tested for desktop Obsidian. Some features assume a typical desktop environment (for example, certain local integrations). **We do not test or support the Obsidian plugin on mobile** today.

**Related:** This repo also includes a separate **Note Companion mobile app** for capture and cloud-backed workflows. Development on that app is currently **on pause**. It is not a replacement for running the Obsidian plugin inside the mobile Obsidian app.

---

## Setup

Open **Settings → Note Companion** and choose one of the paths below.

> **Important:** The Obsidian plugin does **not** have a screen to paste OpenAI / Claude / Gemini API keys directly. Those keys are configured on your **self-hosted backend** (see path 2). The plugin's **License Key** field is for Note Companion Cloud access only.

### Path 1 — Note Companion Cloud (default)

1. Create an account at [notecompanion.ai](https://notecompanion.ai) or sign up / sign in from the plugin's **General** tab
2. Copy your **license key** from the web dashboard (**API Keys**) and paste it into **Settings → Note Companion → General → License Key**
3. Click **Activate**

No cloud account is required for self-hosting (path 2).

### Path 2 — Self-hosted / bring your own provider keys

Use this path to run AI through **your own** OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, or compatible API keys.

1. Deploy the Note Companion backend — see **[SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md)** (Docker or `pnpm build:self-host`)
2. Add provider keys to the server `.env` (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MODEL_PROVIDER`, `MODEL_NAME`; optional `OPENAI_API_BASE` for Ollama or other OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
3. In Obsidian: **Settings → Note Companion → Advanced → Enable Self-Hosting**
4. Set **Server URL** to your backend (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)
5. Leave **License Key** empty or use any placeholder — self-hosted instances with `ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT=false` do not require a cloud license

### Path 3 — Local Ollama (chat only, experimental)

1. Run [Ollama](https://ollama.com) locally
2. Self-host the backend with `OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1`, **or** enable **Experiment → Local LLM Integration** in plugin settings (requires Catalyst access for the in-plugin Ollama path)
3. Select the local model in the chat model picker

### Quick test

- Open Command Palette → **Note Companion: Open Chat**
- Ask: "Summarize this note and suggest tags"

---

## Quick workflows

### 1) YouTube → Note

1. Copy a YouTube link
2. In **Note Companion Chat**, paste the link
3. Get transcript + summary + optional structured notes

### 2) Audio recording → Meeting note (best demo)

1. Open **Meetings** tab → Start Recording
2. Stop Recording → select a note → **Enhance Note**
3. You'll get:
   - embedded audio
   - transcript
   - discussion points + action items

### 3) Inbox auto-organization

1. Create an Inbox folder (configured in settings)
2. Drop raw notes / links inside
3. Note Companion suggests (or auto-applies) folder + tags + title + formatting

## Providers & privacy

| Mode | Where provider keys live | Plugin configuration |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Note Companion Cloud** | Note Companion servers | License key in **General** tab |
| **Self-hosted (BYOK)** | Your server `.env` | **Advanced → Self-Hosting** + Server URL |
| **Local Ollama** | Your machine (Ollama) | Self-hosted `OPENAI_API_BASE` and/or **Experiment → Local LLM** |

Your data handling depends on the mode you choose.
View our full privacy policy at [notecompanion.ai/privacy](https://notecompanion.ai/privacy)

**Cloud Service:**

- Files are processed through our secure API for AI analysis
- Usage statistics collected for billing and rate limits
- Your vault content remains private and is only processed when you explicitly use plugin features
- Account sign-in on the **web dashboard** may offer Google OAuth (Clerk); the in-plugin sign-up uses email/password

**Self-hosted / your provider keys:**

- Provider keys are set on the backend, not in the Obsidian plugin UI
- All AI processing runs on infrastructure you control
- No cloud usage tracking when `ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT=false`

## Self-hosting

Want full control and local infrastructure?

➡️ See **[SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md)** for Docker + service setups and security notes.

---

## Troubleshooting

**If transcription fails:**

- Check provider key, model availability, and file size limits
- Verify API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- For large files (>25MB), consider splitting or compressing

**If YouTube import fails:**

- Try a different fallback method
- Ensure the video is accessible and not private/restricted
- Check network connectivity

**If local model doesn't respond:**

- Verify Base URL and CORS/network settings
- Ensure the local server (e.g., Ollama) is running
- Check firewall settings

**If plugin can't connect to server:**

- Verify **Server URL** under **Settings → Note Companion → Advanced** (check for typos, trailing slashes, http vs https)
- Confirm the backend is running (`curl http://localhost:3000/api/health` or your configured URL)
- Check firewall/network settings

**If chat doesn't work:**

- **Cloud:** verify your **license key** is activated in **General**
- **Self-hosted:** verify provider keys and `MODEL_PROVIDER` / `MODEL_NAME` in the server `.env`, and that self-hosting is enabled in **Advanced**
- Check model availability for your provider
- Enable **Debug Mode** in **Advanced** and review logs there
