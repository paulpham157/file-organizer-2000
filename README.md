## Install

**Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → Browse → "Note Companion" → Install → Enable**

### Platform support (Obsidian)

**This plugin is for Obsidian on desktop only** (Windows, macOS, and Linux). It is marked **desktop-only** in the plugin manifest, so **Obsidian on iPhone, iPad, and Android will not load it** and may show it as unsupported on mobile.

The plugin is built and tested for desktop Obsidian. Some features assume a typical desktop environment (for example, certain local integrations). **We do not test or support the Obsidian plugin on mobile** today.

**Related:** This repo also includes a separate **Note Companion mobile app** for capture and cloud-backed workflows. Development on that app is currently **on pause**. It is not a replacement for running the Obsidian plugin inside the mobile Obsidian app.
